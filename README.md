# Travee
Travee is inspired from yelp.com. Travee is a web Application in which users can find tourist places and review them. Users can also add their own tourist spots. A map has also been displayed for better searching. I have completely revamped the UI and made it into a light and dark mode for reducing eye strain. It is already populated with Indian cities. Implemented a fuzzy search with autocmplete feature using MongoDB Atlas search.
